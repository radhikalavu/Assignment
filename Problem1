Problem statement:
Given a cluster of 100 servers, write automation to install your SSH key on all
of them. Use a tool and approach of your choice.

Solution:
1. Save all 100 fully quaified domain names of the servers to a file called cluster.txt with 1 server per line
2. From the local/tools server where you need the connectivity to all 100 servers
    a. login to the server as user and cd ~
    b. run "ssh-keygen"
    c. run "for server in $(cat cluster.txt); do ssh-copy-id $USER@$server; done
